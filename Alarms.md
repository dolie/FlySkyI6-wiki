Select the sensor or measurement, greater or less than,
and finally the threshold value to compare against.

A convenient use for custom alarms is for notification about signal
strength. There are various measurements related to the signal strength
and quality (Err, RSSI, SNR, etc.). The [recommended way](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=39232193&postcount=3040)
is to use a SNR measurement with limit of 12 dB. Qba667 writes:
