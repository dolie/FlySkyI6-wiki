Current firmware has no longer a battery gauge in the upper right corner, instead a voltage reading is being used.
It is possible to change voltage alarm threshold to any number, by going into Extra>TX Bat. 
The value can be adjusted to use 1S/2S LiPo batteries.
If you use NiCds or NiMH, you can lower the voltage threshold to whatever you feel is best.
